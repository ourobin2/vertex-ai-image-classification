# 🧠 Vertex AI Image Classification Project

This project demonstrates how to train an image classification model using TensorFlow, then deploy it to **Google Cloud Vertex AI** for online prediction.

## 📌 Project Goals

- Train a basic CNN image classification model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Upload the model to Google Cloud Vertex AI Model Registry
- Deploy the model as a REST API Endpoint
- Perform online predictions using the deployed endpoint
